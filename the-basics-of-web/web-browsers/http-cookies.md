# HTTP Cookies

**HTTP cookies** are small pieces of data that are sent from a web server to a user's browser and stored on the userâ€™s device. They are widely used in web development to remember information about users, enhance their browsing experience, and enable essential website functionalities, such as session management, personalization, and tracking.

Remember HTTP is a stateless protocol and hence does not know about previous interactions from the same client.
