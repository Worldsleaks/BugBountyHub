# Encoding

Encoding is crucial for preventing common web attacks like XSS and SQLi, ensuring safe data transmission in both HTTP and HTTPS. It works alongside encryption to maintain secure and error-free communication.

* **Prevents Injection Attacks**: Encoding protects against SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by ensuring special characters are treated as text, not code.
* **Protects URL Integrity**: Encoding ensures that characters like spaces, `&`, and `?` in URLs are correctly interpreted, preventing errors or security issues.
* **Defends Against XSS**: By encoding user inputs, you prevent malicious scripts from being executed on websites.
* **Safeguards Data in HTTPS**: While HTTPS encrypts data, encoding ensures the data format is correct, avoiding injection vulnerabilities even in secure connections.
* **Mitigates Path Traversal**: Encoding prevents attackers from manipulating URLs to access restricted files or directories on the server.
* **Supports APIs**: Proper encoding in RESTful APIs prevents malicious data from being interpreted in dangerous ways, protecting servers from attacks.
