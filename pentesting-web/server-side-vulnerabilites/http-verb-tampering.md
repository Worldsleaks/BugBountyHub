# HTTP Verb Tampering

**HTTP Verb Tampering** is a vulnerability where attackers manipulate HTTP methods to bypass security controls in web applications. Many applications secure certain actions based on specific HTTP methods but they often fail to secure less commonly used methods like PUT, DELETE or PATCH.

In the following example, we can see pattern restrictions applied to GET requests to block SQL injections, but the developers did not consider other HTTP methods:

### Workflow

1. Receive a 401 Unauthorized Response -> indicating the need for valid credentials.
2. **Send an OPTIONS Request ->** This request asks the server to list all the allowed HTTP methods (verbs) for the resource.
3. Attempt to Bypass with Different Verbs -> Knowing which verbs are allowed, change the HTTP method and resend the request to see if bypassing authentication or other restrictions is possible.
