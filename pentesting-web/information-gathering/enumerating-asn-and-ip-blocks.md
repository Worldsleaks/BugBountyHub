# Enumerating ASN and IP blocks

An autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique identifier assigned to an organization or company. It represents a collection of IP addresses that belong to that entity.&#x20;

### 1. Enumerating ASN with bgp.he.net

For instance, we can use [bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net) to identify the ASNs associated with Amazon:

For each found ASN we can then determine the IP ranges assigned to Amazon:
