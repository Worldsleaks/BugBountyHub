# Endpoints

Endpoints are specific paths or URLs where a web server interacts with clients, providing critical functionality. Identifying these endpoints is essential in bug bounty hunting, as they may expose sensitive information or insecure features. This guide demonstrates how to extract endpoints efficiently using web archives with tools like **gau** and **uro**.

## Endpoints from WebArchive

```bash
echo $domain | gau --threads 10 | sort -u | uro
```
