# Passive Subdomain Enumeration

**Passive subdomain enumeration** is a technique used to discover subdomains without directly interacting with the targetâ€™s infrastructure. Instead, it relies on publicly available data sources such as search engines, public DNS records, certificate transparency logs, and third-party services like `VirusTotal`, `SecurityTrails`, or `Shodan`.
