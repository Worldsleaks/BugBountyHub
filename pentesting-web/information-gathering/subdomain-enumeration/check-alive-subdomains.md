# Check Alive Subdomains

Checking for alive subdomains is a crucial step in penetration testing, helping to identify which subdomains are active and reachable. This process narrows the attack surface, focusing efforts on valid targets. In this guide, we'll cover efficient techniques for identifying live subdomains during the information gathering phase.

## [HTTPX](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)

```bash
cat subdomains.txt | httpx 
cat subdomains.txt | httpx -silent -sc -cl --title -o alive_subdomains.txt
```

## [HTTProbe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe)

```bash
cat subdomains.txt | httprobe | anew alive_subdomains.txt
```
