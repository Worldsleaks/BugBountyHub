# Information Gathering

Information gathering, also known as reconnaissance, is the first and one of the most critical phases in **web penetration testing** or **bug bounty hunting**. It involves collecting data about the target system or application to identify potential vulnerabilities. A thorough information-gathering process sets the foundation for identifying and exploiting weaknesses in web applications.
